# 683 K Empty Slots
'''
There is a garden with N slots. In each slot, there is a flower. The N flowers will bloom one by one in N days. In each day, there will be exactly one flower blooming and it will be in the status of blooming since then.

Given an array flowers consists of number from 1 to N. Each number in the array represents the place where the flower will open in that day.

For example, flowers[i] = x means that the unique flower that blooms at day i will be at position x, where i and x will be in the range from 1 to N.

Also given an integer k, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers in the status of blooming, and also the number of flowers between them is k and these flowers are not blooming.

If there isnâ€™t such day, output -1.

e.g. 1
input: flowers = [1,3,2]
       k =1
output:2

e.g. 2
input :flowers = [1,2,3]
       k = 1
output: -1
